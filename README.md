Overview:
Based upon conceptual models developed as part of Washington’s Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) initiative (Fig 1.), we propose to develop qualitative network models with the goal of evaluating aspects of climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on marine resources. The intended end users of these conceptual models are Washington state agencies looking to better inform coastal and ocean management decisions. 

Scope of Work:
We propose to use existing conceptual models for a.) kelp forests and b.) seafloor habitats to develop qualitative network models (QNMs). If time allows, we propose also using the rocky shores habitat conceptual model. Descriptions of these habitats are included alongside the existing conceptual models, shown in Figure 1 at the end of this document. QNM is a conceptually-based tool used to determine the relative influence of different factors on a set of known relationships. While QNMs won’t provide mechanistic understanding or quantitative outputs, they do allow researchers to evaluate hypotheses of how perturbations to one or more ecosystem components influence other components in the system. Since numerous conceptual models have been developed and vetted as part of the MSP effort, leveraging these for rapid development of QNMs would be ideal in the immediate phase.

The focus of the modeling work will be evaluating climate impacts to the selected habitats. The specific question we will address is: “What impacts might we expect on various habitats from individual and cumulative impacts of climate change?” We will adapt the existing conceptual models to include specific drivers of climate change (e.g. sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, pCO2, primary production, as per IPCC, e.g. Henson et al. 2017) and perturb them according to predicted trends (e.g., ↑, ↓, ↑, ↓ for the previous example) to determine what ecosystem components (represented by boxes in the conceptual models) are most affected by these perturbations. Each scenario will be run thousands of times, with random variation introduced into each run; the model output will provide the likelihood (i.e., the proportion of total model runs) that a given outcome is observed. We will invoke these perturbations individually and cumulatively, to understand ecosystem response to individual perturbations and ecosystem responses given multiple stressors, which is a more likely scenario. We will collectively identify a subset of ecosystem components to focus on as response variables (e.g. primary producers, primary consumers, or forage fish). 

We will compare outcomes from the QNMs of the two habitat types where similar response variables allow for comparison. We will also identify the nodes and connections that have the greatest influence or leverage on model outputs, and can then determine if those nodes and connections are monitored effectively or have robust indicators. Tying the modeling effort in with existing ecosystem indicators work (e.g. the development of the conceptual models for the MSP in Andrews et al., 2015) would build continuity and further refine indicators and ecosystem components where monitoring is necessary. 

Working with the MSP team, we would need to identify the ecosystem components of most interest as response variables for any model implementation. The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS) has been working to refine many of these indicators and identify key areas of focus.  Given time constraints, it won’t be feasible to develop models for all habitat types in this initial stage—identification of priority habitats will be necessary and starting with kelp forest and seafloor habitats is of interest to stakeholders. 

Given successful completion of this initial stage, we could further develop the habitat models and build out all three model types of interest (QNM, and also Bayesian Belief Network Models and Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping Models) in habitat-specific forms and compare and contrast the model performance related to some desired objective. Actions under the Marine Spatial Plan (e.g. wind development or oil spill scenarios) could be tested with the qualitative models, given interest and funding in the next biennium.

Deliverables:
•	Summary document from the Initial Meeting 
•	Qualitative Network Models for the two selected habitat types (potentially three depending on time and complexity of the first two models) 
•	R code associated with analysis
•	Final report for the Washington state agency audience
o	This will include a data repository, documentation of reasoning and decision-making, and modeling instructions+. 
•	Draft manuscript for peer-reviewed journal article describing modeling work and outcomes of QNM analysis
•	Presentation to the Washington Coastal Marine Advisory Council (WCMAC) /MSP staff and other interested parties
•	Video recording of a presentation and presentation materials summarizing the findings of the project

Transfer of Deliverables & Next Steps:
•	Robert Wildermuth and UMASS Dartmouth may use the data and results from his work on this project for publication and internal research purposes, but ownership of the models will ultimately reside with Washington State agencies. 
•	Several key components of this project will be identified as part of an iterative process moving forward. During the initial meeting the following details will be discussed and finalized:
o	Refining the key ecological indicators (based on the results of the OCNMS) and how this would affect prioritizing components of the models. 
o	Ownership of the model – where will the models be housed once complete and who will be responsible for maintaining it? How will users access the models and the code?
o	Hand-off strategy once the models are complete.
o	Discuss adding in socioeconomic indicators to the existing conceptual models (i.e. expanding upon the “human wellbeing” and “human pressured” components). 


Meetings:
1. Initial Meeting:
•	Timing: sometime early on in the start of the project, once a preliminary  model is developed
•	Purpose: to go over details and workplan in a meeting/workshop setting with WA state ocean resource managers, technical experts, and state agency staff
2.  Presentation & Outreach
•	Timing: February, when models are complete
•	Purpose: to present the finalized models to stakeholders and potential users of the models: state ocean resource managers and researchers


Personnel:
Chris Harvey and Sean McDonald will serve as a liaisons with the MSP team, serving to bridge existing contributions to the MSP process. They will oversee final documentation and Chris will serve as NOAA team lead. Robert Wildermuth will serve as the primary analyst, developing the QNMs and leading analysis and manuscript development. Gavin Fay will give guidance on analyses, contribute to manuscript and report writing, and provide grant and project management. The group (including Ecology staff) will check-in on a monthly basis to discuss progress and project needs. 


Time Line:
August 1, 2020 – May 31, 2021
